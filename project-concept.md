# Project Concept: Partygeng Marketplace

## 1. High-Level Vision

EventVerse is a two-sided marketplace platform designed to connect Clients (event planners, corporate entities, and individuals) with vetted, professional Event Vendors. The platform's mission is to centralize and streamline the process of discovering, booking, managing, and securely paying for event-related services, replacing the currently fragmented and unreliable methods of finding talent. The core model is analogous to Fiverr but tailored specifically for the event industry.

## 2. Core User Model: A Unified Account

The platform utilizes a unified user account system, similar to Fiverr, where any registered user can act as both a Client (Buyer) and a Vendor (Seller). A user's account is in "Client Mode" by default, and they can choose to activate "Vendor Mode" to offer services.

### 2.1. Client Mode (Default for all users)

- **Definition:** The default state for any registered user. All users can immediately browse, contact, and hire vendors for their events.
- **Primary Goal:** To efficiently find and hire reliable, high-quality vendors. They need to compare options, manage bookings, communicate, and handle payments in a single, secure environment.
- **Key Features:**
  - Event management dashboard to track hired vendors.
  - History of past hired gigs.
  - Ability to leave reviews for vendors.

### 2.2. Vendor Mode (Requires Activation)

- **Definition:** An activated state that allows a user to list their professional services on the marketplace. Activating this mode essentially opens their "storefront" to the public.
- **Primary Goal:** To gain visibility to a qualified client base, streamline their booking and payment process, and build a strong professional reputation through verified reviews.
- **Mandatory Requirements to Activate Vendor Mode:**
  - **Extended Profile:** The user must complete their vendor profile with a detailed bio, a high-quality portfolio (photos/videos), and define their "Service Packages."
  - **KYC Verification:** All users wishing to sell services MUST complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. This is a non-negotiable step to ensure trust and safety.
  - **Paid Subscription:** Vendors MUST have an active paid subscription for their service packages ("gigs") to be publicly listed and discoverable in the marketplace.
- **Key Vendor Features (when activated):**
  - A public-facing storefront profile.
  - Ability to create and manage "Service Packages."
  - Dashboard for managing bookings, communication, and earnings.
  - Verification badges (e.g., "KYC Verified," "Insured," "Top Rated").
- **Vendor Categories:** Staffing agencies, DJs, photographers, videographers, comedians, speakers, party rental companies, personal stylists, bands, solo musicians, and other variety acts.

## 3. The Core Offering: "Service Packages"

Vendors list their services in a structured format called "Service Packages."

- **Tiered Structure:** Similar to Fiverr, packages should be offered in tiers (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium) to provide clear options at different price points.
  - **Example (DJ):** Basic (3 hours, basic lighting), Standard (5 hours, premium lighting, MC services), Premium (Full evening, custom playlist, advanced sound system).
- **Customizable Add-ons:** Clients can add optional extras to a package for an additional fee (e.g., "Extra Hour," "Fog Machine").
- **Custom Quotes:** A critical feature allowing clients to submit a detailed request for unique or large-scale events, which vendors can respond to with a custom-tailored proposal.

## 4. The Booking & Execution Workflow

The user journey is designed to be secure, transparent, and self-contained within the app.

1. **Discovery:** A Client searches for a vendor using filters like category, event type, date/availability, location, and price.
2. **Initial Contact:** The Client finds a vendor and initiates contact. This action creates a dedicated chat context for the inquiry. All communication is logged within this chat.
3. **Quoting:** The Vendor sends an in-app quote to the Client. This is a formal, itemized offer detailing the services, date, time, location, and total cost.
4. **Booking & Payment:**
   - The Client accepts the quote.
   - The Client makes the payment in-app.
   - The funds are held securely in the platform's escrow system. This protects both parties.
5. **Service Execution:** The Vendor performs the service at the event as agreed.
6. **Gig Completion:** After the event, the Client marks the gig as "Complete" in the app. This action triggers the release of funds from escrow to the vendor's account (less the platform's service fee).
7. **Review:** Both the Client and the Vendor are prompted to leave a review for each other, building a transparent and trustworthy community.

## 5. Monetization Strategy

The platform will generate revenue through a hybrid model:

- **Vendor Subscriptions (Primary Requirement):** A recurring monthly or annual fee that vendors must pay to list their services. Different subscription tiers can offer varying levels of visibility and features (e.g., more portfolio uploads, lower commission rates).
- **Commission on Transactions (Service Fee):** A percentage fee (e.g., 15%) is deducted from the vendor's earnings on every successfully completed gig.
- **Promoted Listings (Optional):** Vendors can pay an additional fee to have their profiles featured at the top of search results for specific categories or locations.

## 6. Key Differentiators & Platform Concepts

- **Trust & Safety:** KYC verification and an escrow payment system are the cornerstones of the platform.
- **Availability-First Search:** A built-in calendar system for vendors is crucial. Search results should heavily prioritize vendors who are confirmed to be available on the client's event date.
- **Centralized Event Dashboard:** Clients can manage multiple vendors for a single event from one cohesive interface.
- **Integrated Communication:** All communication, from initial inquiry to post-event follow-up, is handled and logged within the platform.
- **Dispute Resolution:** A formal mediation process to handle cancellations, disagreements, or service quality issues.
